Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (ml_tut.ipynb) that demonstrates various machine learning algorithms and concepts using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.
Contents
The notebook covers the following topics:

Naïve Bayes Classifier: Implementation of a Naïve Bayes classifier for a binary classification problem using Python.
Diabetes Prediction: A comparison of several machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) for predicting diabetes based on various features. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
Data Exploration and Visualization: Exploration of a dataset using correlation heatmaps and other visualizations.
Airport Self Check-In Machine: A simple implementation of an airport self-check-in machine system using Python classes.
